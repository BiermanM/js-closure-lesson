# Outer Function Scope

## Instructions
A software development intern tried creating a function that returns 4 to the power of any given number. For example, 5 should return 625 and 2 should return 16. They created a draft of how they thought it should look, but for some reason it seems to be outputting the wrong value. They mentioned it was likely something to do with the scopes of the variables they created, but that's the farthest they got.

Your task is to get the function to properly output `x` to the power of 4 for any number `x` by commenting out *up to 2 lines* of the function. Since the intern already created most of the function, you don't need to write any lines, just comment out up to 2 lines. Test your solution on more examples than just the one provided to make sure it actually works.

Note: You can run the file while in this directory using the following command in Command Prompt or Terminal: `npm Unsolved.js`
