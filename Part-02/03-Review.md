# Review: Outer Function Scope

Let's review the past two sections about closures:
1. When variables are defined, they have a local scope and can be accessed within that scope.
2. Variables cannot be accessed outside of their local scope.
3. Functions can contain other functions.
4. If function `function1` contains a variable `num` and a function `function2`, `num` can be accessed within `function1` and subsequently also in `function2`.
