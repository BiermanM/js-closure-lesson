# Global Scope

## Instructions
Our team is developing a puzzle game we want to create a function that keeps track of the number of times a user clicks one of the buttons in the game.
1. If the user double-clicks the button, add 2 to the click counter.
2. If the user right-clicks the button, reset the click counter to 0.
3. Otherwise, a.k.a. the user left-clicks the button, add 1 to the counter.
4. Decide where to call the existing `doubleClick` and `rightClick` functions within `clickButton` function. Be careful, the placement will affect how the clicks are counted.
5. To check your work, the code will print out `Number of button clicks: 1` if you did it correctly.

Note: You can run the file while in this directory using the following command in Command Prompt or Terminal: `npm Unsolved.js`
