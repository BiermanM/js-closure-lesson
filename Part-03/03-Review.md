# Review: Global Scope

Let's review everything we've learned about closures:
1. When variables are defined, they have a local scope and can be accessed within that scope.
2. A variable defined in an outer function can be accessed by all of the inner functions as well.
3. A variable defined globally (a.k.a. outside of all functions) can be accessed by all functions.
