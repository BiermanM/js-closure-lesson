## Instructions
We're creating a very simple bank application that allows you to withdraw and deposit money from your bank account.
1. Finish the `withdrawTenDollars` and `depositTenDollars` functions so that they will return a value that is $10 less or $10 more, respectively, of the amount that is passed into the function.
2. Call those functions as many times as needed to get the initial bank account value down to $30.
3. Review all the code again and think about the question at the bottom of file. Explain the thought process behind your decision with the rest of the class.

Note: You can run the file while in this directory using the following command in Command Prompt or Terminal: `npm Unsolved.js`
