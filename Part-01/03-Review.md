# Review: Local Scope

Let's review what we've learned so far about closures:
1. Closure is a function and the data that can be accessed within that function.
2. Scope is the area where a variable can be accessed in.
3. When variables are defined, they have a local scope.
4. Variables cannot be used outside of the closure they were defined in (otherwise you'll get a `ReferenceError`).
